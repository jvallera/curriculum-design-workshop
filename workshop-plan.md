#Curriculum Design Workshop 

![alt text](https://github.com/jvallera/curriculum-design-workshop/blob/master/products/IMG_1167.JPG "Image from workshop")

**The goal of this workshop is to work collaboratively to quickly conceptualize and design engaging, varied, user-centered learning experiences. We’ll start from a spark of an idea and and use information about our audience and a set of constraints to come up with potential iterations, then narrow options to create a super rapid prototype.**

The products will be documented and shared online.

Principles: creative idea generation collaboration user-centered design* rapid prototyping* working open*  

1. **COME UP WITH SOME GROUND RULES FOR COLLABORATION** (3 mins)
    * Solo brainstorm (30 sec)
    * Share out/document together (2.5 mins) 5 or 6 ground rules. Examples:
	   * respectful, active listening
	   * self-awareness (if you usually talk, listen more, if you usually listen, talk more)
	   * don't shoot people down-- try saying “yes, and…”
	     
2. **FREE-WRITE/MAP/DRAW/BRAINSTORM**: (5 minutes total) As a solo activity, free-write or map or draw to brainstorm on our concept: whatever gets you excited, makes you curious, fascinated, thrilled, or fired up about women and girls in STEM (4 mins). Tips
	* Add word associations, connections, questions, feelings, images-- anything that comes to mind when you think about this idea.... 
	* let yourself wander, be open to surprises! Filters off! 
	* Don’t edit. no judgements, don’t think about practicalities— this is an open content exploration. 
	* if you get stuck, free-write/doodle/drift through it. 
	* It’s OK if the thoughts that come to you are tangential to our subject-- you’re not strictly limited to “women and girls in STEM”-- you could begin thinking about space travel, or the future of deep sea research, etc. We will circle back and link to that theme later. 

3. **FIND A SPARK.** Using what you’ve brainstormed, find and record your “spark.” (1 min) Your spark is the idea that’s most captured your attention from the free-write-map-brainstorm session you just did. A spark could be a vision you dream up or imagine, a question you want to explore, something you find fascinatiing, or concept or idea that you’d like to unravel. Write your spark in the center of your sheet of paper. It should be a sentence or less. Your spark is still fairly loose and open-ended-- you’ll work through details later in the workshop.Examples: 
	* vision: the future of women in mathematics
	* fascination: space travel! microbiology! flying cars! 
	* question: what everyday skills are also science skills? what makes a great scientist?
	* idea to explore: women in science in antiquity 
	
	
4. **DEFINE YOUR AUDIENCE** (2 mins). What kind of audience might be interested in learning, teaching, exploring, and/or contributing to the idea/spark you came up with? This may be an audience that you typically work with, or a newer audience. For your target group, try to describe: 
	* Ages/skill level 
	* Background/knowledge 
	* Motivations, interests, affinities 
	* Pitfalls or challenges 

5. **SHARE AND ORGANIZE INTO GROUPS** (10 mins total) 
	* Share out (8 mins total). in a lightning go-around on sparks and audience (5 mins) Example: “My spark is “space travel”; my audience is 8th grade girls who aren’t sold on science but love games and stories.” 
	* Form groups (2 mins). 3-4 people max. We suggest your group agrees on a single audience or similar audiences for good user-centered design. You should also agree on a spark among those created by your members, selecting what resonates most with group.

6. **EXPAND AND CLARIFY**   (5 mins)
	* Read out the spark statement again, 1-2 minute to individual brainstorm to expand or clarilfy the  selected spark/content area: what’s most exciting, interesting; what questions do you have, where do you want more information? What connections/links do you see to bigger concepts, subject areas? If you use standards, consider those. 
	* Together, 3-4 minutes for conversation about expansion and clarification. Try to get to shared language here-- what does this idea include (and exclude)?
	
7. **MEET YOUR MATRIX** A structure to help define your idea and direct tests. (3 mins) It will help you organize varied ideas and tweak them. It also helps you get away from what might be your typical form for a learning experience. Here's an example. Do a series of rapid solo brainstorms (in this ORDER)  **Brainstorm first** because you'll need to do a  a bit of sorting and matching once you have your outcomes. Also, note here that categories can inform each other: your VERBS & ADJECTIVES can help point to FORMS. And be sure to *think about the audience* -- what kinds of forms and verbs and adejctives to this topic align with your user’s motivations and interests?
	* VERBS/ADJECTIVES: verbs can be actions found in the content itself: “collecting” “voyaging,” or they can be things learners will do. For affective adjectives: think qualities, like: “adventurous” or “reflective.” 
	* FORMS: forms can be structures or format for the experience: card game, improv sketch, web page, etc. 
	* DURATIONS: time frames: 15 mins, 45 mins, an afternoon, the entire school year. 
8. **DEFINE OUTCOMES** for the curriulum experience: what will people learn? (5 mins)
An outcome is the result of the activity-- it could be an understanding, a take-away message, a change in behavior, a connection made between two concepts. Create 2-3 outcomes.
    * Start with an Individual brainstorm (1 min): what do you want learners to walk away thinking/knowing/understanding/feeling about this content? Examples: get learners reflecting and asking deep questions about the content, get learners working together, increase confidence, raise awareness of an unknown topic, surprise learners, etc. 
    * Then a discussion/decision together on goals (4 mins) *Be sure to reflect on audience motivations/affinities as well as challenges as you consider your outcomes.*
    
9. **FILL IN YOUR MATRIX** (2 mins) mix and match verbs/adjectives, forms, durations and outcomes.
10. **DESCRIBE YOUR ACTIVITY** using wording from the matrix. (2mins)
	* Example: In this activity, learners will understand women’s contribution to science by discovering a particular scientist, exploring and summarizing her work, and sharing it online as a podcast. This activity takes approximately 3 hours and is appropriate for 8th and 9th graders.
	* Example: In this activity, learners will understand how climate affects them and other living things differently, by researching, writing and drawing to create an almanac for their area/town for the past year (or month). 
11. **PROTOTYPE THE ACTIVITY**  (15+ mins)  Pick one of your rows, and get to work on it! Use the matrix as a guide, and keep your audience in mind, revisiting motivations and challenges as you go. Use paper, pens and other materials to make a quick paper prototype or create an outline. You can use Thimble or GitHub or Google Doc to document and capture. Test out the activity with your group, if possible. OUTPUT: should be a set of instructions or a guide to this activity for learners. 

12. **WRAP-UP/SHARE OUT** (5-10 mins total)
What did you make? Feedback? Thoughts? Questions? DONE! Yaaay!
